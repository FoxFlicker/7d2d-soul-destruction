# ☠️ Soul Destruction - 7 Days to Die

This is a small XML mod for *7 Days to Die* that introduces a scalable, stat-based punishment system called **Soul Destruction**. Instead of traditional death penalties, players accrue **Soul Destruction** each time they die. As this value increases, it progressively reduces player stats such as:

- Maximum Health
- Maximum Stamina
- Carry Capacity
- XP Gain
- Bartering Effectiveness

This is intended to provide consequence to the death system other than a massive XP loss. It isn't a fully fleshed out system, but it helps prevents players from dying to clear their debuffs or restore their vitals.

## 💡 Overview

- Each player death increases **Soul Destruction** by 1000.
- While Soul Destruction is active, a debuff called `Death Becomes You` is applied.
- Over time, Soul Destruction slowly decays (faster when near a campfire).
- All penalties scale dynamically based on your current corruption level.

> ⚠️ This mod doesn't show the exact debuff effects in-game, as it was originally built for private use.

## 📦 Status

- ✔️ Fully working
- ⚠️ Lightly tested
- ❌ No in-game UI for debuff descriptions
- 🧪 Not balanced for public gameplay (yet)

## 📥 Usage

Feel free to use, tweak, or build on it however you like.  
No credit necessary—but a shoutout is always appreciated. 😉

## 🛠️ Future Ideas (if you’re into tweaking mods):

- Add scaling **bonuses** (movement speed, damage) at high destruction levels
- Hook into `perk books` or `progression` to offset corruption decay
- Integrate with in-game UI elements or quests for visibility

Enjoy the suffering. 🔥🧟
